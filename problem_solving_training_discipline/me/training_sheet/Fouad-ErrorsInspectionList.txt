WA:
* breaking a while loop at the not desired position (not tracing the code one more time before submitting)


* Dividing by zero


* Forgetting to break in a loop


* When discovering a bug in the code, I should search for all the similar bugs and fix them all.


* Never dive into an idea if you can’t verify it


* v[i].substr(5,v[i].size()-5); not v[i].substr(5,v.size()-5);
(Be aware of the logic of your code and don’t rush in writing it).


   * When counting the occurrences of a character in a string(upper and lower) or (lower only)?
   * Initializing int ans=0; outside of the class(in topcoder) and forgetting to write ans=0; inside the function. (It caused problems because I was calling a rec function inside the solution’s function)
   * writing find(all(v)) while you want to search in a specific part of v not all of it.
   * While Brute Forcing on some variables, not paying attention to the values they can take.

what i should/n't do ->

problem A
-------

Vanya and fence

-compilation error
i should choose the lang C++ correct with G++ to not get me compilation error




-------------------
LIbraryManagement OOP

-cross initialzation of int bla bla

i should use braces with  case of the switch to give the variable scope


-using getline()  get some error ->  cause i used it after cin 
and the problem is >> of cin leave /n in the buffer and getline get string until get /n
so it will terminate at the first glance
