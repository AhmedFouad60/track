Writing  here what make me get wrong answer 

compile error -> not choosing the right compiler

Run time error -> cause i  assert one of the allowed values in the constrain

compile error -> forget constrain instead of 1000 i typed 100

compile error -> cause i didn't use pow() function in the constrain section and i used instead   ^   symbol

compile error -> cause i used typeof   instead of  auto with tr() macro
wrong answer  -> cause i forget the {} and assume that everything ok

free_ice-cream:

    wrong answer  ->i got WA for the first submition cause i have to check the constraint i should check if the input is outside of int range of equal to it and i have to do opertion involve plus and multiply so i have to use long long int not int "
